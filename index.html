                Wishing you the happiest birthday, Riya 🎉🎂
                I genuinely hope your day is as bright, chaotic, and full of smiles as you are.
                <br><br>
                You know, there’s something very special about the way you are. You’re like a child at heart  full of
                energy, curiosity, and mischief — and honestly, that’s rare. The way you laugh, the way you get excited
                over small things, the way you annoy people just for fun 😄 it makes everything feel lighter.
                <br><br>
                And trust me, that kind of energy matters. You matter. You make people feel comfortable being
                themselves, you bring life into boring moments, and you remind others that it’s okay to be playful,
                silly, and real.
                <br><br>
                I don’t say this lightly, and I’m not just saying this because it’s your birthday  you have a beautiful
                soul. Ye sirf baat nahi hai, I actually mean it. I don’t easily praise people, but when I do, it comes
                from the heart.
                <br><br>
                You might not realize it, but the way you exist, the way you are fearlessly yourself, leaves an
                impact. You’ve made moments better, days easier, and smiles more genuine and that’s something not
                everyone can do.
                <br><br>
                Never lose that childlike spark, that mischief, that warmth. The world already has enough seriousness 
                it needs more people like you.
                <br><br>
                Happy Birthday once again 💫
                Stay exactly the way you are.
            </p>
